* - Implemented sending different kind of tcp requests to the server
* - Test by calling main from shell with a parameter
* - Viable test parameters:
* - - "info"
* - - "auth"
* - - "treat"
*
* - Blocks on "auth" call (tries to receive, but server doesn't send anything atm)
* - createNewConnection() takes enum REQ_TYPE as parameter and thread chooses the correct protocol based
*   on that
* - This allows SystemController to be in charge of the correct request REQ_TYPE
